title: "The Ideal Day"
description: Currently undefined.

The goal with 2100 is to create a framework that anyone can use to construct their ideal day. 

No framework, guide or source of knowledge will be able to completely encapsulate the variety and depth of ways in which people can live but this serves as a starting point using a day as a repeating unit of time around which to organise various activities. 

If you get your daily activities right, you're much more likely to live the life you want to live. You will be able to perform at the highest level intellectually and physically, be better to yourself and the people around you and overall have a greater chance of being who you want to be.

This isn't to say that this frame of thinking is the only "right" way to do things. There is no "right way". Only what makes sense to you and what you decide.
