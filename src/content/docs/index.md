Project 2100 is a documentation project undertaken by Yusuf Sait and Raghav Iyer.

It currently does not have a well defined scope but is generally involved with documenting optimization in the areas of longevity, mental and physical performance, productivity and various projects within our interest fields.

The necessary structures will emerge over time.
