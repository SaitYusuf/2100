It isn't necessary to start a company. This is something that has taken me some time to understand.

I thought that by creating a brand, a logo, a website and getting an official looking email address I had formed the company. When in fact all I had done was try to create an air of legitamcy around my projects. By obscuring myself behind these things and pretending that it was a bigger deal than it actually was.

When in reality the company didn't have any revenue or customers or a team or anything that anyone was striving towards. It was all made up.

This came about because of a lack of understanding about what it meant to start a company. I still don't have a good grasp on it yet but I know what it's not.
