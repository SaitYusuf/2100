We've answered how you can start to figure out what you should spend your time doing.

Now lets understand how you should do it.

The true fundamental currency that you have access to is not time. It is attention.

It's how deeply you can pay attention to the things you're involved in and for how long you're able to do so in a day.

This is in turn sometimes a function of interest. You're more likely to pay attention to something or someone you're interested in but this doesn't necessarly have to be the case. You can choose to pay attention to even your most mundane tasks.

So in other words, what you do and how you do them are both important variables.
