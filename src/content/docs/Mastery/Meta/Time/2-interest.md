Interest seems to a useful variable both in what you choose to do and how well you choose to it.

Interest is not something comes into spontaneous existence. It is simply a product your proclivities and the things you have been exposed to.

You can become interested in virtually anything simply by exposing yourself to more of it and paying attention.

You're not stuck with and you're not defined by your interests.
