## Happiness Metrics

There seems to be two kinds of happiness metrics that can be measured.

One kind that involves rating your happiness moment to moment. So asking the question: "How do you feel in the present moment?"

And the other kind that measures happiness when you look back retrospectively. So asking the question: "How do you feel about how you've spent the last x hours/days/weeks/months/years/decades?"

It seems to me that both need to be taken into account and optimised for. However, the second one is more important. How you feel about the time you have spent so far.

How you feel about the time you have spent so far seems to take in a large number of variables. You look back over the period of time and you think about what you have achieved. The tangible things that carry forward into the present. The things you've built, the things you've done, the personal achivements you've gathered. But for a lot of us it seems to primarily be based on status based achivements. 

Now it's a lie that you can somehow manage to get everything you want out of life. That you'll be able to do everything you wnat to do. There's simply an infinite number of desires and a very limited amount of time so it isn't mathematically possible. 

However, this seems to be one rare area where you may be able to get both moment to moment happiness and retrospective happiness (for the most part). 

## Status Heirarchy

It seems like our progress in the status heirarchy is a strong source of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. How much money we've made, how much stronger we've become, how much better we are in our fields compared to the rest.

It seems primitive to still be looking at these variables when deciding how happy we should be. But I don't know if there's anything particularly wrong with it. Sure we can learn to stop considering these. We're not slaves to our primitive tendencies but the existence of these tendencies doesn't necessitate a resistance to them.

These tendencies are evolutionarily justified. Historically the status in the heirarchy directly deteremined how good your life would be. The differences aren't as drastic today but they still exist. They always will.

So there's nothing wrong with heirarchy. There's nothing wrong with wanting to scale it. However, there's a right way and a wrong way to scale it.

## Maximising Moment to Moment and Retrospective Happiness

The right way to scale the status heirarchy is to pursue mastery. 

One thing that is so satisfying about strength sports is that mastery is so tangible. You are either the stronger person or you aren't. The heirarchy is clear. The undisputable nature of it is immensely satisfying.

If you want to beat someone you have to go away for a period of time. Train as hard as you possibly can, compete and give it everything you have and then you might have a chance. A chance to be at the top or to move up.

This isn't so clear with other endevours. There always seems to be more variables and idiosyncratic ways in which someone is better than another person. And it may even be true. But just like a strenght sport has results, the real world has results as well.

In intellectual and creative pursuits this is determined by the quality of your work. The recognition in most cases follows based on this level.
